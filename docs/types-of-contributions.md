# Types of contributions :memo:

You can contribute to the project in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate!

### :mega: Discussions & :question: Support

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like to help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to
share something amazing you've experimented with our product, join us in
[discussions](https://github.com/Cosmageia/mc-spring-plugin-template/discussions).

The same is possible if you have any question or struggle making something work. The community will
try to find the best way to help you! :sparkles:

### :lady_beetle: Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to
track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue doesn't have any label, this means
we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found a bug, a weird behavior or an exploit, search open issues to see if someone else has
reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using
a [template](https://github.com/Cosmageia/mc-spring-plugin-template/issues/new/choose). We'll use
the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they would be deployed
in the next release by the maintainer. :earth_africa:
